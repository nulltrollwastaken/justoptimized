# Simple Neoforge Modpack that is designed to be as good as we can get it. (icon by oheti on discord)

The following mods include:

    Badopimizations (thosea)
    Cloth Config API (shedaniel)
    Dynamic FPS (juliand665)
    Entity Culling (tr7zw)
    FerriteCore (malte0811)
    ImmediatelyFast (RaphiMC)
    Lithium (CaffeineMC)
    More Culling (FX)
    Sodium (CaffeineMC)
    Sodium Extra (FlashyReese)

## How does it perform against other mod packs?

About the same. I tested it with SO and it was only slightly worse. If your monitor is below 360hz, it shouldn't really matter.
